## 🔍 API Rate Limits

**Amadeus Test API:**
- 4 calls per second (implemented rate limiter)
- 10,000 calls per month
- Token expires every 30 minutes (auto-refresh implemented)

## 📈 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### For Production
1. **Move to Production Amadeus API**
   - Get production credentials
   - Update base URL
   - Higher rate limits

2. **Enhanced Caching**
   - Redis for token storage
   - Deal result caching (15 min)
   - Distributed cache for multiple servers

3. **Real Bookings**
   - Integrate Amadeus booking API
   - Payment processing (Solana Pay)
   - Confirmation emails

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Price alerts
   - Deal recommendations
   - Multi-city flights
   - Hotel amenities filtering

### For Better UX
1. **Location Autocomplete**
   - Use `/api/amadeus/locations` endpoint
   - Dropdown with suggestions
   - Recent searches

2. **Deal Comparison**
   - Side-by-side comparison
   - Save favorites
   - Share deals

3. **Mobile App**
   - React Native version
   - Push notifications
   - QR code scanning

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Test API Data**
   - Limited flight/hotel availability
   - Not all routes have data
   - Results may vary

2. **Session Storage**
   - Deal details stored in sessionStorage
   - Lost on direct URL navigation
   - Consider database storage for production

3. **Token Cache**
   - In-memory (lost on server restart)
   - Use Redis for production
