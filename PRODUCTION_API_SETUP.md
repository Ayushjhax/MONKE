When you get your production credentials, just tell me and I'll:
1. Update all API routes to use production URLs
2. Add environment-based switching
3. Update error handling for production
4. Test with real data

## üé™ For Your Hackathon Presentation

While waiting for production approval, you can:

### Option A: Use Test Data But Label It Clearly
```
Add banner on marketplace:
"üöß Demo Mode - Test data shown. Production will show real hotels/flights"
```

### Option B: Mock Realistic Data
I can create a mock data layer with:
- Real hotel names (Marriott, Hilton, etc.)
- Real cities and prices
- Realistic flight routes
- For demo purposes only

### Option C: Screenshots/Video
Record a demo with production data (if approved) for the presentation

## üìã Hackathon Preparation Checklist

**Before Submission:**
- [ ] Apply for production API (do this NOW - takes 1-2 days)
- [ ] Get production credentials
- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Test with real hotel/flight searches
- [ ] Prepare demo video showing real data
- [ ] Document the API integration in README

**Presentation Points:**
- ‚úÖ "Integrated with Amadeus Production API"
- ‚úÖ "Real-time flight and hotel data from 500+ airlines"
- ‚úÖ "Production-ready with free tier (4,000 calls/month)"

## üö® Important for Hackathon Judges

Make sure to highlight:
1. **"We're using PRODUCTION Amadeus API"** (once you switch)
2. **"This shows REAL hotels and flights"**
3. **"The integration is production-ready"**
4. **"Free tier supports thousands of demo transactions"**

## üÜò If You Can't Get Production Access in Time

Don't worry! I can help with:

1. **Enhanced mock data** - Realistic hotels/flights for demo
2. **Video/screenshots** - Show what production looks like
3. **Documentation** - Explain production integration plan
4. **Fallback mode** - Switch between test and mock data

Judges will understand if you're using test data for a hackathon, but having a clear plan for production is key!
