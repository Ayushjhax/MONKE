## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **Step 1: Start the Development Server**

```bash
cd /Users/ayush/Desktop/MonkeDao/MONKE/frontend
npm run dev
```

The database will initialize automatically with the new tables when the server starts.

---

### **Step 2: Seed Event Data**

You have two options:

**Option A: Use psql (recommended)**
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f scripts/seed-events.sql
```

**Option B: Use a database client**
Copy the SQL from `/frontend/scripts/seed-events.sql` and run it in your PostgreSQL client.

**Option C: Manual API call**
Use the POST `/api/events` endpoint to create events programmatically.

---

### **Step 3: Test Geo-Based Discovery**

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/marketplace
2. Click the **"📍 Deals Near Me"** button (top right)
3. **Connect your Solana wallet** if not already connected
4. Click **"Share Location (Secure)"**
5. **Allow location access** in your browser when prompted
6. Your wallet will prompt you to **sign a message** - this creates the blockchain-verifiable location proof
7. View deals sorted by distance from your location
8. Try different radius options (25km, 50km, 100km, 200km)

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Location proof is signed by your wallet
- ✅ Proof stored in database with 1-hour expiry
- ✅ Deals show distance in kilometers
- ✅ Deals sorted by proximity
- ✅ If no deals found, try increasing radius

---

### **Step 4: Test Crypto Events**

1. From marketplace, click **"🎪 Crypto Events"** button (top right)
2. Browse seeded events:
   - Solana Breakpoint 2025 (Singapore)
   - ETH Denver 2026 (Denver)
   - TOKEN2049 Dubai 2025 (Dubai)
   - Consensus 2025 (Austin)
   - NFT NYC 2025 (New York)
3. Click on any event to view details
4. See linked travel deals (if any match the event dates/location)

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Events display with attendee counts
- ✅ Filter by "Upcoming" or "Popular (10k+)"
- ✅ Event detail pages show dates, location, description
- ✅ Travel deals are auto-matched based on geography + dates
- ✅ Relevance scores shown for matched deals

## 🔐 How Location Verification Works

### **Blockchain-Verified Location Proofs**

1. **User shares location** → Browser geolocation API
2. **Create proof message** → JSON with wallet address, lat/lng, timestamp
3. **Sign with Solana wallet** → `signMessage()` creates cryptographic signature
4. **Submit to server** → API verifies signature against wallet public key
5. **Store in database** → Proof valid for 1 hour, then expires

**Security Features:**
- 🔐 Signature verified using TweetNaCl (ed25519)
- ⏰ Timestamp validation (5-minute window)
- 🕒 Auto-expiry after 1 hour
- 🔒 Cannot be forged without wallet private key
- 🌐 Location data reverse-geocoded to city/country

## 🎯 Event Matching Algorithm

### **How Deals Are Matched to Events**

```typescript
relevance_score = geographic_match (50%) + date_overlap (30%) + price_factor (20%)
```

**Geographic Match:**
- Within 50km: **+0.5 score**
- 50-100km: **+0.25 score**

**Date Overlap:**
- Deal dates align with event ± 2 days: **+0.3 score**
- Partial overlap: **+0.15 score**

**Price Factor:**
- < $500: **+0.2 score**
- $500-$1000: **+0.1 score**

**Match Threshold:** relevance_score ≥ 0.5 (50%)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### **Geo Features**
- [ ] Navigate to `/nearby` page
- [ ] Connect wallet
- [ ] Share location (browser permission)
- [ ] Sign location proof with wallet
- [ ] Verify location displayed correctly
- [ ] Try different radius options (25/50/100/200km)
- [ ] Check distance calculation accuracy
- [ ] Click on deals to view details
- [ ] Test expired location (wait 1 hour or manually delete from DB)

### **Event Features**
- [ ] Navigate to `/events` page
- [ ] Verify 5 seeded events display
- [ ] Toggle "Upcoming" vs "Popular" filters
- [ ] Click on an event
- [ ] Verify event details page loads
- [ ] Check if any deals are linked (depends on Amadeus data)
- [ ] Verify relevance scores if deals present

### **Edge Cases**
- [ ] Test without wallet connected
- [ ] Deny location permission
- [ ] Test with no nearby deals
- [ ] Test location proof expiry
- [ ] Test with empty Amadeus deals table

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **"No verified location found"**
- Ensure you've shared location and wallet signed the proof
- Check `user_location_proofs` table for entry
- Verify `expires_at` is in the future
- Re-share location if expired

### **"No deals found within Xkm"**
- Increase search radius
- Check if `amadeus_deals` table has geo coordinates populated
- The Amadeus data may not have lat/lng values yet

### **Events show "No deals available yet"**
- Normal if Amadeus deals don't match event dates/location
- Manually link deals using `event_linked_deals` table
- Run deal matching algorithm when new deals are cached

### **Location signing fails**
- Ensure wallet is connected
- Try refreshing page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify wallet supports `signMessage()`
