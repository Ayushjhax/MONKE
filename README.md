Build, sell, redeem, and trade digital assets with Solana‚Äôs Compressed NFTs (cNFTs). Driftly gives small businesses programmatic loyalty, verifiable discounts, and secondary-market liquidity ‚Äî at internet scale and near-zero cost (Mint More than 1 Million cNFTs for 0.3 Sol ü§©).

---

### What We‚Äôre Building

- Empower merchants and creators to mint utility NFTs (discounts, memberships, event access) as cNFTs.
- Use on-chain redemption proofs via burn-and-claim mechanics, and Solana Pay for redemption ‚Äî no screenshots, no fraud.
- Enable resale and peer-to-peer offers, staking-based rewards, group deals, social engagement, and geo discovery.
- AI travel assistant and interactive Globe to explore events, social discovery, and book flights/hotels with cNFTs as coupons.

Why cNFTs: ultra-low minting cost, massive scalability (Merkle-compressed), on-chain verifiability, and familiar Metaplex tooling.

---

### Why cNFT for Merchants

- Low minting cost at scale
  - Mint tens of thousands of utility tokens for a fraction of the cost of standard NFTs, thanks to Merkle compression (Bubblegum).
  - Run frequent campaigns (daily deals, seasonal drops) without worrying about chain fees ballooning.

- High throughput and reliable UX
  - Fast confirmations with minimal on-chain footprint; great for time-sensitive redemptions and flash sales.
  - Works with familiar Metaplex standards and tools, reducing integration friction.

- Programmable, interoperable commerce
  - Flexible rules: time-lock, location-lock, one-time burn-and-claim, transferability, and resale.
  - On-chain verifiability allows partners (POS, marketplaces) to trust redemption state without centralized reconciliation.
  - Secondary markets unlock liquidity and price discovery for promotions and memberships.


üí° Hackathon teams: see [`MONKE/template/README.md`](https://github.com/Ayushjhax/MONKE/blob/main/MONKE/template/README.md) to integrate Driftly‚Äôs cNFT module directly.

### Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayushjhax/MONKE.git
cd MONKE/frontend
npm install

# Create your environment
cp .env.example .env   # then edit values

# Run the app
npm run dev
# App: http://localhost:3000
```

---

### Environment (.env)

Create `frontend/.env.local` (or `MONKE/frontend/.env`) and set:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_MOCK_DATA=true

# Helius API Key
NEXT_PUBLIC_HELIUS_API_KEY=
HELIUS_API_KEY=

# Solana RPC
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_DEVNET_RPC_URL=

# Pinata IPFS
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_API_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY=

# Database (Postgres)
DATABASE_URL=

# Amadeus (Flights/Hotels)
AMADEUS_API_KEY=
AMADEUS_API_SECRET=

# Cohere (AI)
COHERE_API_KEY=

# Mapbox
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=

# Razorpay
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=
```

Notes:
- Helius: set both public (client) and server keys where used; public used for DAS reads in frontend.
- RPC: use a devnet RPC for consistent performance.
- Pinata: used to upload/serve metadata and images for NFTs.
- DATABASE_URL: Postgres connection string used by `frontend/lib/db.ts` and API routes.
- Amadeus: required for flight/hotel search and booking simulation endpoints.
- Cohere: powers the AI travel assistant (`/api/ai-agent/chat`).
- Mapbox: enables maps and nearby discovery UI.
- Razorpay: used for order creation and payment verification.


### Features (from code)

- Marketplace & Resale
  - List cNFTs for sale, browse active listings with on-chain asset data, purchase, transfer post-sale, and manage ‚Äúmy assets‚Äù and ‚Äúmy listings‚Äù.

- Resale P2P (Binance-style)
  - Peer‚Äëto‚Äëpeer offers and transfers for cNFTs: make/respond to offers, coordinate payment/escrow, mark transfer complete, and settle accepted trades end‚Äëto‚Äëend ‚Äî optimized for P2P resale.

- Group Deals (Tiered pricing)
  - Create tiered group campaigns where discounts unlock as participation grows. A host opens a group, shares an invite link, and participants join with pledges. Groups auto‚Äëlock on expiry/progress; redemptions are issued and tracked per member.

- Staking & Rewards
  - Stake eligible cNFTs to accrue rewards over time; initiate cooldown to unstake; claim aggregated rewards and view rich user staking stats.

- Redemption (Burn-and-Claim + Solana Pay)
  - On-chain redemption proof using burn-and-claim semantics; optional Solana Pay flow for payment-based redemption; supports time-locked and location-locked QR payloads.

- QR Codes
  - Generate encoded QR payloads for redemptions and validate scans with expiry and integrity checks.

- Social Discovery Layer
  - Profiles, ratings, reviews, votes, comments with threads and moderation flags, activity feeds, notifications, community stats, and trending signals.

- Geo Discovery
  - Submit signed location proofs and surface nearby deals; Mapbox-based UI for exploration.

- Events + Globe
  - Curated crypto/NFT events with geo metadata; interactive globe and event pages to discover deals tied to events.

- Travel + Amadeus
  - Flight/hotel discovery and booking simulation using Amadeus APIs; redeem discounts by burning the cNFT coupon and applying savings at booking time.

- Merchants
  - Merchant sync and registry to associate collections, wallets, and campaigns.
  - Create in 2 simple steps: (1) create a Collection and Merkle Tree, (2) mint your cNFTs.

- Payments
  - Razorpay order creation and payment verification for fiat on‚Äëramps in local development. Use test keys locally and verify callbacks while running the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

- AI Travel Assistant
  - Conversational assistant (Cohere) to suggest events, routes, and deals; integrates with discovery and booking flows.

- cNFT Minting & Collections
  - Create and manage collections, assist with utilities, and maintenance tasks like fixing expiry or resetting usage counters.

- System Init & Migrations
  - Initialize and migrate Postgres schemas; helper routes/utilities for local setup and data evolution.
