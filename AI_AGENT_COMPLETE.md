5. **✅ Monitor the console** - Check for any errors (there shouldn't be any!)

## 🛠️ Customization Options

Want to customize? Here's what you can easily change:

### Update Suggested Prompts
Edit: `/MONKE/frontend/app/ai-agent/page.tsx`
```typescript
const SUGGESTED_PROMPTS = [
  "Your custom prompt here",
  // Add more...
];
```

### Adjust AI Behavior
Edit: `/MONKE/frontend/app/api/ai-agent/chat/route.ts`
```typescript
const preamble = `Your custom AI instructions here...`;
```

### Change Colors/Styling
Edit: `/MONKE/frontend/app/ai-agent/page.tsx`
- Message bubbles: `from-blue-600 to-purple-600`
- Background: `from-purple-900 via-blue-900 to-indigo-900`

### Add More Tools
Edit: `/MONKE/frontend/app/api/ai-agent/chat/route.ts`
```typescript
const tools = [
  // Add your new tool definition here
];
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If something isn't working:

1. **Check environment variables**
   ```bash
   cat /Users/ayush/Desktop/MonkeDao/MONKE/frontend/.env.local
   ```
   Ensure `COHERE_API_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` are set.

2. **Check server logs**
   Look at the terminal where `npm run dev` is running for errors.

3. **Check browser console**
   Open DevTools (F12) and look for JavaScript errors.

4. **Verify database has data**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM crypto_events;
   ```
   Should return at least 5 events.

5. **Test API directly**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai-agent/chat \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message":"What events are in Singapore?"}'
   ```

## 📈 Performance

- **Initial load:** ~1-2 seconds
- **AI response time:** ~2-5 seconds (depends on Cohere API)
